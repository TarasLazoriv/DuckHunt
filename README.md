## Duck Hunt Description

**1. Project Name:**

* **Duck Hunt**

**2. Short Description:**

* This project serves as a demonstration of the Command Package's capabilities.
* It illustrates the key concepts and patterns implemented in the package.
* The project has no practical purpose, but it helps developers understand how to use the Command Package in their own projects.

**3. Project Goals:**

* Demonstrate the core components of the Command Package (commands, executors, runners).
* Showcase the benefits of using the package (readability, flexibility, testability).
* Provide examples of implementing the package in the Unity context.

**4. Implementation Description:**

* The project utilizes the following Command Package components:
    * `ICommand` to define execution logic.
    * `ICommandExecutor` to determine when a command should be executed.
    * `ICommandRunner` to determine where a command should be executed.
* Various usage scenarios are demonstrated:
    * Executing commands outside of the Unity context.
    * Utilizing the standard Unity component system.
    * Employing a mixed approach, combining different variants.
* The project illustrates:
    * Registering commands, executors, and runners.
    * Creating custom executors and runners.
    * Running commands through executors.

**5. Benefits of Using Command Package:**

* The project vividly demonstrates the advantages of the Command Package:
    * **Enhanced code readability:** Logic, time, and place of execution are separated.
    * **Improved flexibility:** Easy to modify execution logic, time, and place independently.
    * **Extendability:** Ability to create custom executors and runners for diverse scenarios.
    * **Testability:** Simple to test individual components (commands, executors, runners).
    * **Reusability:** Commands can be easily reused across different parts of the code.

**6. Demonstration:**

* The project includes code examples illustrating the use of the Command Package.

**7. Future Development:**

* This demonstration project can be expanded in the future by:
    * Adding real-world usage examples.
    * Implementing more complex scenarios.
    * Integrating with other libraries and frameworks.

**8. Conclusion:**

* Duck Hunt is a valuable tool for exploring the Command Package's capabilities.
* It helps developers grasp the advantages of the Command pattern and its practical application in Unity.
* The demonstration can serve as a starting point for creating their own solutions using the Command Package.
